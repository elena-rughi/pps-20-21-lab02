    Currying
      - Implement a predicate that checks whether its arguments x, y , z respect
        the relation x ≤ y ≤ z, in 4 variants (curried/non-curried × val/def)
          val p1: <CurriedFunType> = ...
          val p2: <NonCurriedFunType> = ...
          def p3(...)(...)(...): ... = ...
          def p4(...): ... = ...
          Notice: function types and function literals are syntactically similar
